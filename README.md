# MatchFlix

**This is still a work in progess.**

MatchFlix is a recommendation site for Netflix. It is unique in that it allows users to add their friends and get recommendations based on two profiles. I made this to explore recommendation algorithms, in-particular for combining two-profiles as there does not appear to be any succseful algorithm for this to-date.

### Usage

To get the images run 'utils/image_scraper.py'. To populate the database run 'manage.py populate_db data.csv'.

### Acknowledgements

I found [this](https://dev.to/joshwizzy/customizing-django-authentication-using-abstractbaseuser-llg) tutorial very helpful for authentication.

I used The Movie Database (TMDb) API to get images.
